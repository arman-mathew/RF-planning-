ðŸŽ¯ GOAL:
From a layer of building centroids, automatically group them (~100 per group), place one gateway per group, and symbolize it.

âœ… STEP-BY-STEP IN QGIS
Step 1: Prepare Your Data
You should have a point layer of building centroids (let's say it's named centroids).

Make sure your project CRS is projected (meters) â€” e.g., EPSG:32643 (UTM zone for India).

Step 2: Install Plugins (if needed)
Open Plugins â†’ Manage and Install Plugins

Install:

MMQGIS

DBSCAN Clustering (optional)

Step 3: Cluster Points (~100 Centroids Each)
Option A: Using MMQGIS
Go to MMQGIS â†’ Create â†’ Hub Distance Clusters

Choose:

Layer: centroids

Hub Distance: Start with 100 meters (adjust until you get clusters of ~100 points)

Run the tool â€” it will create a cluster field (CLUSTER_ID) in the attribute table.

Option B: Using DBSCAN Plugin
Processing â†’ Toolbox â†’ DBSCAN clustering

Choose:

Input layer: centroids

Epsilon (max distance): e.g., 80

Minimum points: 100

Output will have a cluster ID field.

Step 4: Compute Cluster Centers (Gateways)
Go to Processing Toolbox â†’ Mean coordinate(s)

Input layer: centroids

Group by field: CLUSTER_ID

This creates a new point layer, where each point is the center of a cluster (i.e., your gateway!)

Step 5: Buffer Gateways
Processing Toolbox â†’ Buffer

Input layer: your gateway layer

Distance: 100 meters (or more depending on spacing)

Result: Gateway coverage areas (circles).

Step 6: Symbolize Gateways
Right-click your gateway layer â†’ Properties â†’ Symbology

Change symbol to:

Marker symbol (e.g., WiFi icon or antenna from SVGs)

Choose color (e.g., red or blue)

Increase size

You can also add labels like "Gateway 1", "Gateway 2", etc.

âœ… Final Output
A layer of gateways centered on building centroid clusters

Buffers showing their coverage

Clearly symbolized for easy map reading
