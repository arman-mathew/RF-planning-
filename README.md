Yes, **it is possible** — you don't have to import the whole building footprints for all of Jaipur!

You can **clip** or **filter** the building footprints **to only your selected area**.

Here’s how you can do it 🔥:

---

### 📍 **Option 1: Download Full Data → Clip to Selected Area in QGIS**

**Step 1: Download the full building footprint file**  
(even if it's large — maybe GeoJSON or SHP file).

**Step 2: Load it in QGIS.**

**Step 3: Draw your area of interest (AOI)**  
- Go to **Layer → Create Layer → New Temporary Scratch Layer**.
- Set Geometry Type as **Polygon**.
- Draw a polygon around the area you want (like Jaipur center, or a specific colony).

**Step 4: Clip the Building Footprints**
- Go to **Vector → Geoprocessing Tools → Clip**.
- Input layer: **building footprints**.
- Clip layer: **your drawn polygon (AOI)**.
- Run it.
- It will give you **only the buildings inside your area**!

### 📍 **Option 2: Filter using "Select by Location"**

If you don't want to clip permanently, you can just select buildings inside your area:

- **Vector → Research Tools → Select by Location**.
- Select buildings **that intersect** your drawn AOI.
- Right-click the layer → **Export → Save Selected Features As** → save a new layer.

Result = only buildings of your selected area!

### 🚀 If You Want to Make It Faster (without downloading full file):

You can also use **Google Earth Engine** to directly extract just your AOI — but that needs coding a little bit in JavaScript.

Would you like me to quickly give you a **ready code** for extracting just your area using **Google Earth Engine** too? 🌟 (It will be easier if you want to avoid huge downloads!)
